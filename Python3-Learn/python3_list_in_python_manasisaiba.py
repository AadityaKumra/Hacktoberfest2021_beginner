#Python offers a range of compound data types often referred to as sequences.
# List is one of the most frequently used and very versatile data types used in Python.

# empty list
my_list = []

# list of integers
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# list with mixed data types
my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]
#A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list.
# nested list
my_list = ["mouse", [8, 4, 6], ['a']]
